# Exploratory Data Analysis â€” Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python to extract insights, identify trends, and understand relationships between features.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook with full EDA code and output
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` â€” PDF report of findings and visual explanations
- `titanic.csv` â€” Dataset used

## ðŸ“Š What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the dataset
- Plotted various visualizations (histogram, boxplot, heatmap, pairplot)
- Identified key relationships (Fare vs Survival, Age distribution, etc.)
- Summarized findings in PDF format

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Passengers paying higher fare had better survival rate
- Majority passengers were in age group 20â€“40
- Pclass negatively correlated with Survival
